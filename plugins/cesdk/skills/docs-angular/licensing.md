Thanks for your interest in CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK).

We offer flexible commercial licensing options to support teams and projects of all sizes. Whether you're building a new product or scaling an existing one, our goal is to provide the best creative editing experience—backed by a licensing model that aligns with your needs.

Get in touch with us through our [contact sales form](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales).

## Commercial Licensing

CE.SDK is offered through a subscription-based commercial model. This allows us to:

- Deliver ongoing updates and performance improvements
- Ensure compatibility with new browsers and devices
- Provide dedicated technical support
- Build long-term partnerships with our customers

## How Licensing Works

CE.SDK licenses are tied to a single commercial product instance, verified by the hostname for web apps and bundle/app ID for mobile apps.

Licensing typically uses remote validation and includes lightweight event tracking. It’s possible to disable tracking or use offline-compatible options. To explore these options, [contact our sales team](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales).

## Trial License Key

Trial licenses are available for evaluation and testing and are valid for **30 days**. They provide full access to CE.SDK’s features so you can explore its capabilities in your environment.

If you need more time to evaluate, [contact our sales team](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales).

## Testing and Production

Paid license keys can be used across development, staging, and production environments. Multiple domains or app identifiers can be added to support this setup.
