## What is the Auto-Resizer Solution?

The Auto-Resizer is a prebuilt solution powered by CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) that lets you embed automated design resizing into your web app. Whether you're building a content creation tool, campaign manager, or internal marketing portal, this solution helps your users create consistent assets across platforms — without relying on manual design work.

This solution can be used programmatically or with a visual UI, and integrates directly into your existing web application.

## Key Features

- **Automatic multi-size generation**\
  Resize a single design template into multiple platform-optimized dimensions in just one click.

- **Supports common formats**\
  Output ready-to-use designs for:

  - Instagram Story (1080 × 1920 px)
  - Instagram Post 4:5 (1050 × 1350 px)
  - X (Twitter) Post (1200 × 675 px)
  - Facebook Post (1200 × 630 px)

- **Editable results**\
  After auto-resizing, users can still fine-tune each version individually, offering flexibility where needed.

- **Templated consistency**\
  Enforce layout and brand consistency across sizes with predefined design constraints.

- **No design team needed**\
  Empower marketers and non-designers to create professional, on-brand variations at scale.

## Why Use This Solution?

Creating multiple size variations for each campaign can quickly become a bottleneck. The auto-resizer eliminates repetitive work by generating size-adapted versions of a single design — while still allowing edits to fine-tune each one.

With this solution, you can:

- Accelerate content production across teams and platforms
- Reduce dependency on design resources
- Ensure brand consistency in every output
- Integrate resizing into your app with minimal development effort
