The Postcard Editor is a prebuilt CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) solution designed for quickly creating and personalizing postcards and greeting cards. It provides an intuitive UI that guides users through selecting a design, editing its contents, and customizing messaging—all without needing design expertise.

With built-in support for style presets, design constraints, and variable-driven personalization, the Postcard Editor enables scalable creation of high-quality, print-ready content for direct mail, seasonal greetings, and personalized campaigns.
