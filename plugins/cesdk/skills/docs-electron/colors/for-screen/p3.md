Understand the P3 wide color gamut and its availability across CE.SDK platforms.

> **Not Available on Web:** P3 colors are not currently supported on Web platforms. Use [sRGB colors](./colors/for-screen/srgb.md) instead.

P3 enables more vibrant reds, greens, and other colors beyond the standard sRGB gamut. This is valuable for displays that support the DCI-P3 color space, including modern Apple devices and high-end monitors.

## What is P3?

The DCI-P3 color space was developed for digital cinema and has been widely adopted in consumer displays, particularly by Apple since 2016. P3 covers roughly 25% more visible colors than sRGB, especially in the red, orange, and green-cyan regions.

Key differences from sRGB:

- **Gamut size**: P3 encompasses a larger color range
- **Primary colors**: P3 red and green are more saturated
- **Backwards compatibility**: P3 content on sRGB displays is automatically converted

P3 colors only appear more vibrant on P3-capable displays. On sRGB displays, colors are converted and may appear less saturated.

## Platform Support

**Supported platforms:**

- **Android**: `supportsP3()` and `checkP3Support()` APIs
- **iOS/Swift**: `supportsP3()` and `checkP3Support()` APIs

**Not supported:**

- Browser
- Server (Node.js)

On Web platforms, CE.SDK uses sRGB as the working color space. The Web binding supports sRGB, CMYK, and Spot Colors.

## P3 vs sRGB: When to Use Each

| Use Case | Recommended |
| --- | --- |
| Native mobile apps (Apple devices) | P3 |
| Photo/video editing with color accuracy | P3 |
| Web applications | sRGB |
| Cross-platform consistency | sRGB |

## Next Steps

- [sRGB Colors](./colors/for-screen/srgb.md) — Apply sRGB colors for screen output
- [Color Conversion](./colors/conversion.md) — Convert between color spaces
