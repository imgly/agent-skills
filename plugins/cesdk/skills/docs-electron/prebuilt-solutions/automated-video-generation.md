Generate dynamic videos from reusable templates — right inside your web app. The Automated Video Generator is a pre-built solution powered by CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK), designed for developers who want to streamline video content creation at scale.

This solution can be embedded as a fully interactive UI or used headlessly via CE.SDK’s programmatic API, giving you full flexibility to match your product’s workflow and user experience.

## What is the Automated Video Generator Solution?

The Automated Video Generator is a customizable web-based solution that enables you to build templated video experiences using CE.SDK. It supports both user-facing UIs and headless automation — so whether you want users to edit videos manually or generate them via scripts and data inputs, the choice is yours.

At its core, the editor supports **video placeholders**, allowing you to create flexible templates where users or automation scripts can drop in new assets, text, or colors — without altering layout integrity or brand guidelines.

This pre-built solution is ideal for content automation platforms, marketing tools, social media management dashboards, or any workflow where video personalization and speed are critical.

## Key Features

- **Video placeholders for automation**\
  Define editable areas in a video template that users or scripts can replace with their own clips, images, or content — all while keeping layout consistency.

- **Permission-based constraints**\
  Configure placeholder behavior in “creator” mode to restrict movement, styling, or deletion — ensuring end-users stay on-brand.

- **UI or headless execution**\
  Use the interactive editor for in-app editing, or automate video generation entirely via CE.SDK’s headless API.

- **Scalable output generation**\
  Generate multiple variations of a video by swapping placeholder content — ideal for social campaigns, product showcases, or ad creatives.

- **Web-optimized experience**\
  Fully compatible with modern browsers and built for seamless integration in React or vanilla JavaScript apps.

## Why Use This Solution?

- **Fast time to value**\
  Get up and running quickly with a plug-and-play editor that’s already configured for video automation.

- **Boost user productivity**\
  Reduce manual video editing by letting your users start from structured templates — or bypass editing altogether with programmatic generation.

- **Flexible and brand-safe**\
  Empower non-designers to create custom content without breaking brand guidelines.

- **Developer-first architecture**\
  Built on CE.SDK’s modular API and headless engine, so you can adapt it to fit UI-driven workflows or backend automation.
