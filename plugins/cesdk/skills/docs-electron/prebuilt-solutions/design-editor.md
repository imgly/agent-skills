## What is the Design Editor Solution?

The Design Editor is a pre-built configuration of the CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK), tailored for non-professional users to easily adapt and personalize existing templates. It’s optimized for workflows that focus on editing layout elements like text, images, and shapes — all within clearly defined design constraints.

Whether you're building a product customization app, dynamic ad creator, or template-based marketing tool, the Design Editor brings a polished, user-friendly interface to your users — right out of the box.

## Key Features

- **Template-based editing**\
  Empower users to customize existing templates while preserving brand integrity and layout rules.

- **Smart context menus**\
  Clicking an element opens a simplified editing toolbar, showing only the most relevant actions — like replacing or cropping an image.

- **Streamlined user interface**\
  The interface is designed to surface essential tools first. A “More” button reveals the full set of features for deeper editing.

- **Role-based permissions**\
  Easily toggle between *Creator* and *Adopter* roles to define what elements users can modify, lock, or hide.

- **Cross-platform support**\
  Available for Web, iOS, Android, and Desktop — all powered by the same core SDK.

## Why Use This Solution?

The Design Editor is the fastest way to offer layout editing with production-ready UX. It reduces the effort of building a complete UI from scratch, while giving you full control over customization and integration.

Choose this solution if you want to:

- Provide a ready-to-use template editor that feels intuitive to end users
- Accelerate your time to market with a polished layout editing experience
- Maintain creative control by restricting editable areas with template constraints
- Avoid building custom design tooling for every use case
