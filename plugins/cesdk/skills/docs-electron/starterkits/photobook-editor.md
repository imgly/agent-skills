## What is the Photobook Editor Solution?

The Photobook Editor is a pre-built solution built with CE.SDK’s headless API. It’s designed to help developers quickly deliver a fully functional photobook creation experience inside their app. This solution limits complexity for end users by exposing only the most relevant tools: theming, layout selection, and photo placement.

From weddings to holidays to portfolios, the Photobook Editor makes it easy to start from themed templates, drop in photos, and customize each page with simple, intuitive controls.
