Animations in CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) bring your designs to life by adding motion to images, text, and design elements. Whether you're creating a dynamic social media post, a video ad, or an engaging product demo, animations help capture attention and communicate ideas more effectively.

With CE.SDK, you can create and edit animations either through the built-in UI timeline or programmatically using the CreativeEngine API. Animated designs can be exported as MP4 videos, allowing you to deliver polished, motion-rich content entirely client-side.
