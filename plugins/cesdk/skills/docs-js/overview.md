Use CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) to build robust video editing experiences directly in your app. CE.SDK supports both video and audio editing — including trimming, joining, adding text, annotating, and more — all performed client-side without requiring a server. Developers can integrate editing functionality using a built-in UI or programmatically via the SDK API.

CE.SDK also supports music and sound effects alongside video editing. You can integrate custom or third-party AI models to streamline creative workflows, such as converting image to video or generating clips from text.
