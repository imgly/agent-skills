## What is the Data Merge Solution?

The Data Merge solution uses CreativeEditor SDK’s headless API to dynamically generate visual assets from structured data inputs. Whether you’re creating team cards, event badges, certificates, or product listings, this solution lets you interpolate variable content—like names, images, and departments—into reusable design templates.

It’s designed for scalability: update a master template once, and the changes automatically propagate to all generated instances. You can also enable manual edits per instance to fine-tune layout and content where needed.

## Key Features

- **Headless Rendering**\
  Generate scenes programmatically using CE.SDK’s headless API—ideal for server-side or automation workflows.

- **Data Interpolation**\
  Merge content from arrays, spreadsheets, or APIs directly into placeholders and text variables within your templates.

- **Editable Outputs**\
  Each generated design remains editable, allowing for manual adjustments like resizing images or correcting long names.

- **Template Propagation**\
  Edits made to the original template automatically apply to all downstream instances—ensuring brand consistency and saving time.

- **Flexible Input Sources**\
  Use structured data from JSON, databases, or third-party APIs to populate templates.

## Why Use This Solution?

- **Automate Creative Workflows**\
  Scale content production without scaling your design team. Perfect for marketing campaigns, catalogs, team profiles, and more.

- **Maintain Visual Consistency**\
  Centralized templates and automatic propagation reduce errors and ensure all materials align with brand guidelines.

- **Speed Up Production**\
  Eliminate repetitive design tasks by generating dozens—or thousands—of personalized outputs with a single operation.

- **Flexible Integration**\
  Use the Data Merge solution programmatically in headless environments or combine it with the CE.SDK UI for hybrid workflows.
