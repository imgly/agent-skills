**Navigation:** [Upgrading](./upgrade.md) > [To v1.10](./to-v1-10.md)

---

Version v1.10 introduced major changes to how and where engine and the UI store assets.
This guide helps you navigate those changes and explains what you need to do to bring your integration up to speed.

## 1. Scene Uploads are no longer serialized

Image uploads are no longer stored in the scene and will not reappear upon scene load. To offer specific assets in your editor, configure and [add an asset source](./serve-assets.md) containing the desired assets.

## 2. Deprecating Extensions

Starting with `v1.10` we fully embrace [Asset Sources](./import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash.md) as our standard interface for asset management.
We're deprecating extension packs, previously stored in `/assets/extensions` and indexed via `manifest.json` files.

**Fonts are not affected by this deprecation yet, but will receive the same treatment in an upcoming version.**

We'll deprecate the `config.extensions` field for `CreativeEditorSDK`.
As part of this deprecation, we'll **no longer ship** the following packs in the `/assets/extensions` directory in our `npm` packages:

- `ly.img.cesdk.images.samples`
- `ly.img.cesdk.shapes.default`
- `ly.img.cesdk.stickers.doodle`
- `ly.img.cesdk.stickers.emoji`
- `ly.img.cesdk.stickers.emoticons`
- `ly.img.cesdk.stickers.hand`
- `ly.img.cesdk.vectorpaths`
- `ly.img.cesdk.vectorpaths.abstract`

To keep offering the contained assets in your deployment, use our new [convenience functions](#making-use-of-default-and-demo-asset-sources) to instantiate asset sources holding these assets.
If you have existing scenes where an asset from an extension pack might be included, you must make sure you're still serving the corresponding files from your baseURL, so that `<baseURL>/extensions/…` paths still resolve properly.
You can acquire a copy of the extension packs shipped in `v1.9.2` [from our CDN](https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.9.2/assets/extensions.zip).
Otherwise your scenes will **render missing asset alerts**.

### 2.1 Making use of Default and Demo Asset Sources

We still want to offer a package, that has all batteries included and quickly gets you up to speed.
To do so, we introduced two new convenience functions, that can be used to add a set of predefined asset sources to your integration:

#### `addDefaultAssetSources`

Adds a set of asset sources containing our default assets.

These assets may be used in production and [served from your own servers](./serve-assets.md).
The assets are parsed from the IMG.LY CDN at `{{base_url}}/<id>/content.json`, where `base_url` defaults to `https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v1`.
Each source is created via `addLocalSource` and populated with the parsed assets.
You can specify your own `base_url` or exclude certain source IDs.

The following sources are added:

| ID                        | Description                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `'ly.img.sticker'`        | Various stickers                |
| `'ly.img.vectorpath'`     | Shapes and arrows               |
| `'ly.img.filter.lut'`     | LUT effects of various kinds.   |
| `'ly.img.filter.duotone'` | Color effects of various kinds. |

#### `addDemoAssetSources`

Registers a set of demo asset sources containing our example assets.
These are not to meant to be used in your production code.

The assets are parsed from the IMG.LY CDN at `https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1`.
The `sceneMode` and `withUploadAssetSources` parameters control whether audio/video and upload sources are added.

The following sources are added:

| ID                      | Description                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `'ly.img.image'`        | Sample images                      |
| `'ly.img.image.upload'` | Demo source to upload image assets |
| `'ly.img.audio'`        | Sample audios                      |
| `'ly.img.audio.upload'` | Demo source to upload audio assets |
| `'ly.img.video'`        | Sample audios                      |
| `'ly.img.video.upload'` | Demo source to upload video assets |

#### Modifying Default & Demo Sources

After registration you can freely modify the contained assets using the Asset APIs.
You can add or remove entire asset sources or individual assets.

#### Upload Asset Sources

The upload asset sources and library entries for video and audio were added to the default configuration from `addDefaultAssetSources`. If you have added these sources manually (like mentioned in our video docs) you can remove them now.

## 3. AssetAPI Changes

To further streamline interaction, the following breaking changes were made to the AssetAPI:

- The `applyAsset` callbacks and `defaultApplyAsset` API now return an optional design block id in their callback if they created a new block.
- `thumbUri` and `size` properties in `AssetDefinition` and `AssetResult` are now part of the `meta` property dictionary.
- Values of the `blockType` asset meta property must now be design block type ids (e.g. `//ly.img.ubq/image`)

## 4. A New Way to Add Images

Instead of specifying additional images for the `CreativeEditorSDK` in `config.presets.images`, you should make use of `asset.addAsset` and add your images into the `ly.img.image` asset source.

## 5. General API Changes

The `blockType` `meta` property for assets changed from `ly.img.<type>` to fully qualified block types: E.g. `'ly.img.image'` now needs to be `'//ly.img.ubq/image'`.

As we're starting to apply the 'fill' concept to more parts of the interface, we deprecated various fill color related APIs:

- Deprecated `hasFillColor`, use `hasFill` and query `block.getEnum(id, 'fill/type')` for `Solid` type instead.
- Deprecated `get/setFillColorRGBA`, use `setFillSolidColor`instead..
- Deprecated `isFillColorEnabled`, use `isFillEnabled` instead.
- Deprecated `setFillType` and `setFillGradientType`, use `createFill`, e.g., with type 'color' and then apply the fill block with `setFill` to the block instead. If the block has a fill, it should be removed with `getFill` and `destroy`.
- Deprecated `getFillType` and `getFillGradientType`, query `block.getEnum(id, 'fill/type')` and `block.getEnum(id, 'fill/gradient/type')` instead instead
- Deprecated `add/removeFillGradientColorStop` and `get/setFillGradientColorStops`.
- Deprecated `get/setFillGradientControlPointX/Y`, use `block.getFloat(fill, keypath)` and `block.setFloat(fill, keypath, value)` with key paths 'fill/gradient/linear/startPointX/Y', 'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointX/Y', and 'fill/gradient/conical/centerPointX/Y' instead.
- Deprecated `get/setFillGradientRadius`, use `block.getFloat(fill, 'fill/gradient/radial/radius')` and `block.setFloat(fill, 'fill/gradient/radial/radius', value)` instead."

`camera/clearColor` property was replaced it with a global `clearColor` setting to allow controlling the clear color before loading a scene.

Properties affecting playback that existed on both `Audio` and `VideoFill` where moved to a common `playback/` namespace:

- `'fill/video/looping'` and `'audio/looping'` are now `'playback/looping'`
- `'fill/video/volume'` and `'audio/volume'` are now `'playback/volume'`
- `'fill/video/muted'` and `'audio/muted'` are now `'playback/muted'`
