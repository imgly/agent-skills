## Type Parameters

|  `currentPage` | `number` | The current, requested page |
|  `nextPage?` | `number` | The next page to query if it exists |
|  `total` | `number` | How many assets are there in total for the current query regardless of the page |
|  `facets?` | `object` | Distributions for the requested facet paths, keyed by the exact requested path string. Ordered by count descending, ties by value ascending.
