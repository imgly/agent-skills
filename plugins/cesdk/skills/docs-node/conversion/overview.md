## Supported Input and Output Formats

CE.SDK accepts a range of input formats when working with designs, including:

When it comes to exporting or converting designs, the SDK supports the following output formats:

Each format serves different use cases, giving you the flexibility to adapt designs for your application’s needs.

## Customization Options

When exporting designs, CE.SDK offers several customization options to meet specific output requirements:

- **Resolution and DPI Settings:**\
  Adjust the resolution for raster exports like PNG to optimize for screen or print.

- **Output Dimensions:**\
  Define custom width and height settings for the exported file, independent of the original design size.

- **File Quality:**\
  For formats that support compression (such as PNG or PDF), you can control the quality level to balance file size and visual fidelity.

- **Background Transparency:**\
  Choose whether to preserve transparent backgrounds or export with a solid background color.

- **Page Selection:**\
  When exporting multi-page documents (e.g., PDFs), you can select specific pages or export all pages at once.

These options help ensure that your exported content is optimized for its intended platform, whether it's a website, a mobile app, or a print-ready document.
