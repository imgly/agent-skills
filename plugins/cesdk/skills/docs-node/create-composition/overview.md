In CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK), a *composition* is an arrangement of multiple design elements—such as images, text, shapes, graphics, and effects—combined into a single, cohesive visual layout. Unlike working with isolated elements, compositions allow you to design complex, multi-element visuals that tell a richer story or support more advanced use cases.

All composition processing is handled entirely on the client side, ensuring fast, secure, and efficient editing without requiring server infrastructure.

You can use compositions to create a wide variety of projects, including social media posts, marketing materials, collages, and multi-page exports like PDFs.
