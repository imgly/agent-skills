The CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) offers powerful image editing capabilities designed for seamless integration into your application. You can give your users full control through an intuitive user interface or implement fully automated workflows via the SDK’s programmatic API.

Image editing with CE.SDK is fully client-side, ensuring fast performance, data privacy, and offline compatibility. Whether you're building a photo editor, design tool, or automation workflow, CE.SDK provides everything you need—plus the flexibility to integrate AI tools for tasks like adding or removing objects, swapping backgrounds, or creating variants.

## Core Capabilities

CE.SDK includes a wide range of image editing features accessible both through the UI and programmatically. Key capabilities include:

- **Background removal**: Automatically remove backgrounds from images using plugin integrations.
- **Color tools**: Replace colors, apply gradients, adjust palettes, and convert to black and white.
- **Vectorization**: Convert raster images into vector format (SVG).
- **Programmatic editing**: Make all edits via API—ideal for automation and bulk processing.

All operations are optimized for in-app performance and align with real-time editing needs.
