Video cropping in CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) allows you to trim video content to focus on specific areas, remove unwanted elements, or adjust aspect ratios for different platforms. This transformation is essential for optimizing videos for social media, removing distracting elements, or creating custom framing effects.

You can crop videos both through the built-in user interface and programmatically using the SDK's APIs, providing flexibility for different workflow requirements.

## Cropping Methods

CE.SDK supports several approaches to video cropping:

- **Interactive Cropping**: Visual crop area selection with real-time preview
- **Aspect Ratio Presets**: Quick crop to common social media and platform formats
- **Programmatic Cropping**: Precise crop control through scale, translation, and rotation
- **Group Cropping**: Apply consistent crop settings across multiple video elements

## Applying Crops

### UI-Based Cropping

You can crop videos directly in the CE.SDK user interface using interactive crop controls. Users can drag crop boundaries, select preset aspect ratios, and see real-time previews, making it easy to frame content perfectly for any platform.

### Programmatic Cropping

Developers can apply cropping programmatically, using the SDK's API. This allows for automated cropping based on content analysis, batch processing, and integration with custom workflows or template systems.

## Combining with Other Transforms

Video cropping works seamlessly with other transformation operations like rotation, scaling, and positioning. You can chain multiple transformations to create complex effects while maintaining video quality and performance.
