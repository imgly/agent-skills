It’s designed for developers, product teams, and technical decision-makers evaluating how CE.SDK fits their use case.

- 100% client-side processing
- Custom-built rendering engine for consistent cross-platform performance
- Flexible enough for both low-code and fully custom implementations

## Multi-modal

CE.SDK supports a wide range of content types and formats:

- Input types: images, video, audio, structured data, templates
- Output formats: PNG, JPEG, WebP, PDF, raw data

All operations—including export—run client-side, ensuring fast performance and data privacy.

## Extensibility

Need to add a custom feature or integrate with your backend? CE.SDK supports extensibility at multiple levels:

- Backend data integrations (e.g., asset management systems)
- Custom logic or validation rules
- Advanced export workflows

The SDK’s plugin architecture ensures you can scale your functionality without rebuilding the core editor.

## Content Libraries

CE.SDK ships with a robust system for managing reusable content:

- Built-in libraries of stickers, icons, overlays, and fonts
- Integration with third-party providers like Getty Images, Unsplash, or Airtable
- Programmatic filtering and categorization
- Organize by brand, user, or use case

This makes it easy to deliver a seamless editing experience—no matter how many assets you manage.
