Use CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) to build robust video editing experiences directly in your app. CE.SDK supports both video and audio editing — including trimming, joining, adding text, annotating, and more — all performed from the server. You can automate editing actions via the SDK API.

Alongside video editing, CE.SDK also supports:

- Voiceover
- Music
- Sound effects

You can integrate custom or third-party AI models to streamline creative workflows, such as converting an image to video or generating clips from text.
