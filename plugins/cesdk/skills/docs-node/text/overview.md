In CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK), a *text element* is an editable, stylable block that you can add to your design. Whether you're creating marketing graphics, social media posts, or multilingual layouts, text plays a vital role in conveying information and enhancing your visuals. You can fully manipulate text elements using the programmatic APIs, giving you maximum flexibility to control how text behaves and appears. Additionally, text can be animated to bring motion to your designs.
