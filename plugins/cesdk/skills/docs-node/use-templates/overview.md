Templates in CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) are pre-designed layouts that serve as starting points for generating static designs, videos, or print-ready outputs. Templates can be used to produce a wide range of media, including images, PDFs, and videos.

Instead of creating a design from scratch, you can use a template to quickly produce content by adapting pre-defined elements like text, images, and layout structures.

Using templates offers significant advantages: faster content creation, consistent visual style, and scalable design workflows across many outputs.

## Working with Dynamic Content

CE.SDK templates support dynamic placeholders for content such as text, images, and custom elements. You can replace dynamic content programmatically. External data (e.g., from a database, CSV file, or API) can be merged automatically into placeholders without requiring user interaction.

This flexibility supports both one-off customizations and large-scale content generation scenarios.

## Exploring the Template Library

Templates are stored, organized, and managed through the CE.SDK Template Library. This library acts as a centralized place where templates are categorized and retrieved.

You can work with:

- **Default Templates**: Templates that come bundled with the SDK to help you get started quickly.
- **Custom Templates**: Templates you create based on your specific use case, offering full flexibility over design, dynamic fields, and editing constraints.
- **Premium Templates**: Additional high-quality templates provided by IMG.LY, which can be integrated into your application if licensed.

## Output Formats When Using Templates

When generating outputs from templates, CE.SDK supports:

Templates are format-aware, allowing you to design once and export to multiple formats seamlessly. For example, a single marketing template could be used to produce a social media graphic, a printable flyer, and a promotional video, all using the same underlying design.
