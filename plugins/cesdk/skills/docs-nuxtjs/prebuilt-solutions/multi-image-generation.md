## What is the Multiple Image Generator Solution?

The Multiple Image Generator is a prebuilt web solution built on top of CE.SDK that enables developers to programmatically generate multiple design variations from a single data input. This is especially useful for automating content creation at scale — such as product promotions, social media visuals, or user-generated reviews — while ensuring design consistency.

This solution uses CE.SDK’s headless API to interpolate structured data into customizable templates. Developers can easily embed it into their applications to deliver dynamic image generation without requiring manual design work.

## Key Features

- **Programmatic design generation**\
  Automatically populate templates with structured data using CE.SDK’s variable and placeholder APIs.

- **Multi-template support**\
  Generate different branded variants of the same content for different platforms or audiences.

- **Headless API**\
  Run design logic entirely in code — no UI required — making it easy to integrate with backends or automation workflows.

- **Template-driven design**\
  Easily update or swap templates to reflect new branding, formats, or campaign needs.

- **Live preview and export**\
  Review auto-generated assets in real time and export them in a variety of formats for production use.

## Why Use This Solution?

The Multiple Image Generator helps developers:

- **Accelerate content workflows**\
  Eliminate repetitive design tasks by generating multiple assets from structured data, such as CSV rows or API responses.

- **Maintain brand consistency at scale**\
  Every output adheres to a pre-defined visual standard — ensuring a polished and on-brand result.

- **Embed creative automation into apps**\
  Offer your users the ability to personalize and publish visual content dynamically, all within your platform.

- **Scale across platforms**\
  Generate variants for different social media formats, marketing channels, or regional campaigns in one flow.

This prebuilt solution is ideal for platforms focused on product marketing, social content automation, reviews, or e-commerce — and gives you full control over templates, logic, and output.
