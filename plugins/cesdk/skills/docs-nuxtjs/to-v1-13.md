In version v1.13, the way the CreativeEngine and
CreativeEditor SDK are configured has changed. Several configuration options
that were previously passed to `CreativeEngine.init()` or `CreativeEditor
SDK.init()` have been removed or replaced. This document will explain the
changes and describe the steps you can take to adapt them to your setup.

#### CreativeEditorSDK initialization

We are also introducing a new way of instantiating the CreativeEditorSDK, that
provides more precise control over the initialization. Using
`CreativeEditorSDK.create()`, you have the chance to configure the SDK before
loading or creating a scene. This was not possible before. When using
`CreativeEditorSDK.init()`, the SDK would create the initial scene before giving
you the option to perform additional configuration via the API.

The `create()` method will not create an initial scene for you. You need to do
that yourself, using either the Scene API at `cesdk.editor.scene`, or one of the
methods on the CreativeEditorSDK instance itself (`createDesignScene`,
`createVideoScene`, `loadFromUrl`, `loadFromString`).

### Rationale

Over time the number options you could pass into the call to
`CreativeEngine.init({...config})` has grown quite a bit. Initially this was the
only place where you could configure the behavior and settings of the
CreativeEngine, but over the past year we introduced several new APIs. One of those APIs
is the EditorAPI, which lets you

[adjust](./settings.md) many
[settings](./settings.md) at runtime, not just at the launch of the app.

To improve consistency of our APIs, we decided to scale back the options
available in the configuration object in favor of changing settings via the
EditorAPI. The only options that remain are those that are strictly necessary
for the initialization of the CreativeEngine, such as the `baseUrl` and
`license`.

These changes were performed with the Creative Engine in mind, but since the
CreativeEditor SDK shares a lot of the same code, the changes described in this
document also apply to the configuration for the CE.SDK.

### Changed configuration options

The following is a list of all configuration options that have been changed or
removed, along with instructions on how to migrate the use of these options in
your codebase:

- `scene` options (`dpi`, `pixelScaleFactor`) have been removed.
  `scene/dpi` and `scene/pixelScaleFactor` can now be found as [properties on the scene in the BlockAPI](./concepts/blocks.md).
- `page` options have been removed.
  - `page.title.show` has been replaced with `cesdk.engine.editor.setSettingBool('page/title/show', enabled)`
  - `page.title.fontFileUri` has been replaced with `cesdk.engine.editor.setSettingString('page/title/fontFileUri', uri)`
  - `page.dimOutOfPageAreas` has been replaced with `cesdk.engine.editor.setSettingBool('page/dimOutOfPageAreas', dimEnabled)`
- `assetSources` have been removed. To add asset sources, use the AssetAPI at `cesdk.engine.asset`.
- `preset.colors` has been removed as it was never used, previously.
- `presets.colorPalettes` has been removed from CreativeEngine as it was not used. It has been moved to `ui.colorPalette` in the CESDK.
- `presets.images` has been removed. To add assets and asset sources, use the AssetAPI at `cesdk.engine.asset`.
- `presets.pageFormats` has been removed from the CreativeEngine as it was not used. Is has been moved to `ui.pageFormats` in the CESDK.
  Previously it was possible to mark a page format as default by setting `meta: {default: true}` in it.
  In `ui.pageFormats`, this has been simplified, to just `default: true`.
- `variables` has been removed. Use the [VariableAPI](./create-templates/add-dynamic-content/text-variables.md) instead.
- `callbacks.log` has been moved to `logger`. Previously the logger callback would take
  a `Loglevel` enum as a second parameter. This enum has been removed. Instead you can
  define the loglevel with plain strings `'Warning' | 'Error' | 'Info' `

### Change initialization code

To ensure your users perceive a consistent UI experience, settings that have been moved
to api calls should be made immediately after initializing the CreativeEngine.
For the Creative Editor SDK, use the `create()` method, instead of `init()`

#### CreativeEngine

```
const engine = await CreativeEngine.init(config);
// 1. Configure Engine
engine.editor.setSettingEnum('doubleClickSelectionMode', 'Direct');
// ... other settings

// 2. Create/load scene
const sceneId = await engine.scene.create();

// 3. Append Engine canvas element to the DOM
document.getElementById('my-engine-container').append(engine.element);

// ... your application code
```

#### CreativeEngine SDK

```
const cesdk = await CreativeEditorSDK.create('my-engine-container', config);
// 1. Configure SDK
cesdk.engine.asset.addSource(myAssetSource);
// ... other settings

// 2. Create/load scene
const sceneId = await cesdk.createDesignScene(myPageFormats[pageFormatId]);

// ... your application code
```

### Fallback and warnings

The CreativeEngine and CreativeEditor SDK still interpret the config object with
its previous settings.
If removed configuration options are detected during intialization, a warning is
printed to the console, with individual instructions on how to migrate them.
It is recommended to adjust your configuration as described above for the best
compatibility with future developments and to get rid of these warnings.

The fallback mechanism is not enabled for the new `CreativeEditorSDK.create()`
method! Passing removed configuration options to `create()` will cause that
option to be ignored and an error will be printed to the console.

### CreativeEngine Typescript definitions

The more complex parts of our configuration (such as the page format definitions)
were previously exporting type definitions under the `ConfigTypes` namespace
in the CreativeEngine package. This namespace and all the types in it have been removed or moved elsewhere.

For now we still export `ConfigTypes`, but have marked it and its members as `@deprecated`.
Most of them are not used at all anymore, the rest have been moved elsewhere:

- `ConfigTypes.Color` can now be imported directly as `PaletteColor`
- `ConfigTypes.TypefaceDefinition` can be imported directly, as `TypefaceDefinition`.
- `ConfigTypes.PageFormatDefinition` can be imported directly as `PageFormatDefinition` (CE.SDK only).
- `ConfigTypes.Logger` can be imported directly as `Logger`

The `LogLevel` enum that was previously used by `Logger` has been replaced with
a string union (`'Warning' | 'Error' | 'Info'`).

### CreativeEditorSDK Typescript definitions

The CreativeEditor SDK package still *does* export a `ConfigTypes` namespace.

For use with the new `CreativeEditorSDK.create()`, we are offering a new type
`CreateConfiguration`, which is lacking all of the removed keys instead of
marking them as deprecated.

### Demo asset sources

When adding demo asset sources using `cesdk.addDemoAssetSources()`, or
`engine.addDemoAssetSources()`, make sure to specify the correct scene mode. The
installed demo asset sources vary between Design and Video modes.

If you don't specify a scene mode, `addDemoAssetSources()` will try to add the
correct sources based on the current scene, and default to `'Design'`. If you
call `addDemoAssetSources()` *without* a scene mode, and *before* loading or
creating a video scene, the audio and video asset sources will not be added.
