Design elements in CE.SDK are organized in a hierarchical parent-child structure. Children of a block are rendered in order, with the last child appearing on top. This layer stack model gives you precise control over how elements overlap and interact visually.

```

This guide covers how to navigate the block hierarchy, reorder elements in the layer stack, toggle visibility, and manage block lifecycles through duplication and deletion.

## Creating Visual Blocks

To demonstrate layer ordering, we create colored rectangles that overlap on the canvas. Each block is created using `engine.block.create()` and configured with a shape, fill color, dimensions, and position.

```typescript highlight=highlight-create-block
// Create a colored rectangle
const redRect = engine.block.create('graphic');
engine.block.setShape(redRect, engine.block.createShape('rect'));
const redFill = engine.block.createFill('color');
engine.block.setFill(redRect, redFill);
engine.block.setColor(redFill, 'fill/color/value', {
  r: 0.9,
  g: 0.2,
  b: 0.2,
  a: 1
});
engine.block.setWidth(redRect, 180);
engine.block.setHeight(redRect, 180);
engine.block.setPositionX(redRect, 220);
engine.block.setPositionY(redRect, 120);
```

## Navigating the Block Hierarchy

CE.SDK organizes blocks in a parent-child tree structure. Every block can have one parent and multiple children. Understanding this hierarchy is essential for programmatic layer management.

### Getting a Block's Parent

We retrieve the parent of any block using `engine.block.getParent()`. This returns the parent's block ID, or null if the block has no parent (such as the scene root).

```typescript highlight=highlight-get-parent
// Get the parent of a block
const parent = engine.block.getParent(redRect);
console.log('Parent of red rectangle:', parent);
```

Knowing a block's parent helps you understand where it sits in the hierarchy and enables operations like reparenting or finding sibling blocks.

### Listing Child Blocks

We get all direct children of a block using `engine.block.getChildren()`. Children are returned sorted in their rendering order, where the last child renders in front of other children.

```typescript highlight=highlight-get-children
// Get all children of the page
const children = engine.block.getChildren(page);
console.log('Page children (in render order):', children);
```

This method is useful for iterating through all elements on a page or within a group.

## Adding and Positioning Blocks

When you create a new block, it exists independently until you add it to the hierarchy. There are two ways to attach blocks to a parent: appending to the end or inserting at a specific position.

### Appending Blocks

We add a block as the last child of a parent using `engine.block.appendChild()`. Since the last child renders on top, the appended block becomes the topmost element.

```typescript highlight=highlight-append-child
// Add blocks to the page - last appended is on top
engine.block.appendChild(page, redRect);
engine.block.appendChild(page, greenRect);
engine.block.appendChild(page, blueRect);
```

When you append multiple blocks in sequence, each new block appears in front of the previous ones.

### Inserting at a Specific Position

We insert a block at a specific index in the layer stack using `engine.block.insertChild()`. Index 0 places the block at the back, behind all other children.

```typescript highlight=highlight-insert-child
// Insert a new block at a specific position (index 0 = back)
const yellowRect = engine.block.create('graphic');
engine.block.setShape(yellowRect, engine.block.createShape('rect'));
const yellowFill = engine.block.createFill('color');
engine.block.setFill(yellowRect, yellowFill);
engine.block.setColor(yellowFill, 'fill/color/value', {
  r: 0.95,
  g: 0.85,
  b: 0.2,
  a: 1
});
engine.block.setWidth(yellowRect, 180);
engine.block.setHeight(yellowRect, 180);
engine.block.setPositionX(yellowRect, 160);
engine.block.setPositionY(yellowRect, 60);
engine.block.insertChild(page, yellowRect, 0);
```

This gives you precise control over where new elements appear in the stacking order.

### Reparenting Blocks

When you add a block to a new parent using `appendChild()` or `insertChild()`, it is automatically removed from its previous parent. This makes reparenting operations straightforward without needing to manually detach blocks first.

## Changing Z-Order

Once blocks are in the hierarchy, you can change their stacking order without removing and re-adding them. CE.SDK provides four methods for z-order manipulation.

### Bring to Front

We move an element to the top of its siblings using `engine.block.bringToFront()`. This gives the block the highest stacking order among its siblings.

```typescript highlight=highlight-bring-to-front
// Bring the red rectangle to the front
engine.block.bringToFront(redRect);
console.log('Red rectangle brought to front');
```

### Send to Back

We move an element behind all its siblings using `engine.block.sendToBack()`. This gives the block the lowest stacking order among its siblings.

```typescript highlight=highlight-send-to-back
// Send the blue rectangle to the back
engine.block.sendToBack(blueRect);
console.log('Blue rectangle sent to back');
```

### Move Forward One Layer

We move an element one position forward using `engine.block.bringForward()`. This swaps the block with its immediate sibling in front.

```typescript highlight=highlight-bring-forward
// Move the green rectangle forward one layer
engine.block.bringForward(greenRect);
console.log('Green rectangle moved forward');
```

### Move Backward One Layer

We move an element one position backward using `engine.block.sendBackward()`. This swaps the block with its immediate sibling behind.

```typescript highlight=highlight-send-backward
// Move the yellow rectangle backward one layer
engine.block.sendBackward(yellowRect);
console.log('Yellow rectangle moved backward');
```

These incremental operations are useful for fine-tuning the layer order without jumping to extremes.

## Controlling Visibility

Visibility allows you to temporarily hide elements without removing them from the scene. Hidden elements remain in the hierarchy and preserve their properties, but are not rendered.

### Checking and Toggling Visibility

We query the current visibility state using `engine.block.isVisible()` and change it using `engine.block.setVisible()`.

```typescript highlight=highlight-visibility
    // Check and toggle visibility
    const isVisible = engine.block.isVisible(blueRect);
    console.log('Blue rectangle visible:', isVisible);

    // Hide the blue rectangle temporarily
    engine.block.setVisible(blueRect, false);
    console.log('Blue rectangle hidden');

    // Show it again for the final composition
    engine.block.setVisible(blueRect, true);
    console.log('Blue rectangle shown again');
```

Visibility is useful for creating before/after comparisons, hiding elements during editing, or implementing show/hide functionality in your application.

## Managing Block Lifecycle

CE.SDK provides methods for duplicating blocks to create copies and destroying blocks to remove them permanently.

### Duplicating Blocks

We create a copy of a block and all its children using `engine.block.duplicate()`. By default, the duplicate is attached to the same parent as the original.

```typescript highlight=highlight-duplicate
// Duplicate a block
const duplicateGreen = engine.block.duplicate(greenRect);
engine.block.setPositionX(duplicateGreen, 400);
engine.block.setPositionY(duplicateGreen, 300);
// Change the duplicate's color to purple
const purpleFill = engine.block.createFill('color');
engine.block.setFill(duplicateGreen, purpleFill);
engine.block.setColor(purpleFill, 'fill/color/value', {
  r: 0.6,
  g: 0.2,
  b: 0.8,
  a: 1
});
console.log('Green rectangle duplicated');
```

The duplicated block is positioned at the same location as the original. You typically want to reposition it to make it visible as a separate element.

### Checking Block Validity

Before performing operations on a block, we can verify it still exists using `engine.block.isValid()`. A block becomes invalid after it has been destroyed.

```typescript highlight=highlight-is-valid
// Check if a block is valid before operations
const isValidBefore = engine.block.isValid(yellowRect);
console.log('Yellow rectangle valid before destroy:', isValidBefore);
```

### Removing Blocks

We permanently remove a block and all its children from the scene using `engine.block.destroy()`. This operation cannot be undone programmatically.

```typescript highlight=highlight-destroy
    // Remove a block from the scene
    engine.block.destroy(yellowRect);
    console.log('Yellow rectangle destroyed');

    // Check validity after destruction
    const isValidAfter = engine.block.isValid(yellowRect);
    console.log('Yellow rectangle valid after destroy:', isValidAfter);
```

After destruction, any references to the block become invalid. Attempting to use an invalid block ID will result in errors.

## Framing the Result

After making layer changes, we zoom to fit the page in the viewport so the composition is clearly visible.

```typescript highlight=highlight-zoom
engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, 40, 40, 40, 40);
```

## Troubleshooting

**Block not visible after appendChild**: The block may be behind other elements. Use `engine.block.bringToFront()` or adjust the insert index to control stacking order.

**getParent returns null**: The block is not attached to any parent. Use `engine.block.appendChild()` or `engine.block.insertChild()` to attach it to a page or container.

**Changes not reflected**: The block handle may be invalid. Check with `engine.block.isValid()` before performing operations.

**Z-order not updating**: Verify you're operating on the correct block ID and that the block is in the expected parent context.

**Duplicate not appearing**: If `attachToParent` is set to false, the duplicate won't be attached automatically. Set it to true or manually attach the duplicate to a parent.
