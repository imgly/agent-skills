## What is the T-Shirt Designer Solution?

The T-Shirt Designer is a pre-configured instance of the CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) tailored for apparel design workflows. It enables your users to create high-quality, print-ready t-shirt designs directly in your app—whether for a custom merchandise platform, print-on-demand storefront, or internal design tool.

This solution comes with a realistic t-shirt mockup background, precise boundary enforcement, and a simplified UI. You can easily integrate it across web, mobile, or desktop platforms and customize it to match your brand or workflow.

## Key Features

- **T-Shirt backdrop with placement guidance**\
  A visually accurate t-shirt background helps users place artwork exactly where it will appear when printed.

- **Strict print area enforcement**\
  Elements that extend beyond the defined print region are clipped automatically, ensuring print precision.

- **Placeholder-based template editing**\
  Supports templates with editable placeholders, such as swappable images. Define which parts of a design are user-editable by toggling between Creator and Adopter modes.

- **Print-ready PDF export**\
  Outputs print-quality PDFs to seamlessly fit into your existing production workflows.

- **Fully customizable UI**\
  Adapt the interface and features to suit your brand and user needs using the CE.SDK configuration API.

## Why Use This Solution?

- **Accelerated development**\
  Save engineering time with a ready-made editor specifically configured for t-shirt design.

- **Better user experience**\
  The focused UI reduces complexity, guiding users through apparel creation with built-in visual feedback and safeguards.

- **Seamless print integration**\
  The export format and boundary enforcement make it ideal for print-on-demand systems with no additional post-processing required.

- **Flexible and extensible**\
  As with all CE.SDK solutions, the T-Shirt Designer is deeply customizable—extend features, change design constraints, or integrate external data and asset libraries.
