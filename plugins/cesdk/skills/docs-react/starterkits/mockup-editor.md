## What is the Mockup Editor Solution?

The Mockup Editor is a ready-to-use interface powered by CE.SDK that lets users preview designs mapped directly onto real-world product surfaces. This preview experience helps users catch layout issues early and make informed design decisions—especially useful in e-commerce, print-on-demand, and marketing workflows.

This solution is optimized for a seamless in-browser experience and supports a variety of common formats:

- **Apparel**
- **Business cards**
- **Postcards**
- **Posters**
- **Social media visuals**

Each format comes with a tailored preview mode, ensuring realistic and product-specific mockups.

## Key Features

- **Live Preview Rendering**\
  All design changes are immediately reflected in the mockup preview, allowing users to validate their work without switching tools.

- **Fullscreen & Export Support**\
  Users can enter fullscreen mode for a closer inspection of the final product and export their mockup directly from the interface.

- **Editable Design Surface**\
  Reopen the design view from within the mockup preview to tweak layout, background, sizing, and other style elements—all without leaving the flow.

- **Multiple Mockup Types**\
  Preconfigured mockups for apparel, stationery, and digital assets let you tailor the experience to your use case.

## Why Use This Solution?

The Mockup Editor offers a powerful combination of usability and flexibility:

- **Reduce Friction**\
  Let users preview and refine designs in one place—no back-and-forth between editing tools and preview windows.

- **Accelerate Go-to-Market**\
  Help teams move faster by streamlining visual validation in workflows like product launches, custom merchandise, or campaign content.

- **Enhance Personalization**\
  Ideal for platforms offering user-generated content or product customization. Integrate the Mockup Editor to give users a visual proof of concept before ordering or publishing.

- **Easy to Embed**\
  Designed for developers, the Mockup Editor can be added to any web app with minimal setup. Customize the experience or use it as-is to quickly provide professional-grade mockup previews.
