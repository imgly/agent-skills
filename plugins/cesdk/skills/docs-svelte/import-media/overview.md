In CE.SDK, assets are the building blocks of your creative workflow—whether they’re images, videos, audio, fonts, or templates. They power everything from basic image edits to dynamic, template-driven design generation.

This guide gives you a high-level understanding of how to bring assets into CE.SDK, where they can come from, and how to decide on the right strategy for your application. Whether you're working with local uploads, remote storage, or third-party sources, this guide will help you navigate your options and build an efficient import pipeline.
