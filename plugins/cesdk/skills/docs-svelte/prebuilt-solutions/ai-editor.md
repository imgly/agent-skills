## What is the AI Editor Solution?

The AI Editor is a fully integrated CE.SDK configuration that enables image, video, audio, and voice generation directly inside your app’s editing interface. Users can start from a text prompt, an existing image, or video element—and generate high-quality, royalty-free content in seconds.

Each AI tool is context-aware and accessible via the task bar or element-specific actions, creating a smooth and uninterrupted creative experience for your users.

## Key Features

### Generate images

Turn text prompts or base images into photorealistic or stylized visuals. Output raster or vector formats, with styles such as:

- Studio portrait
- Pixel art
- Moodboard
- Social post
- Product mockup

### Generate videos

Transform a single image or prompt into a short, 5-second animated video. Users can define visual tone and animation style. Great for:

- Social content
- Concept animation
- Branding visuals

### Generate audio

Create royalty-free soundtracks and effects from simple prompts like “ambient synth loop” or “forest sounds.” Outputs are ready to use in CE.SDK’s video timeline.

### Generate AI voiceovers

Type a script and select from natural-sounding voice profiles. Adjust speed to match your content and add voiceovers to explainer videos or product demos.

### In-context AI tools

Interact with any element on the canvas—text, image, or video—and apply intelligent enhancements:

- Rewrite or improve text
- Translate and fix grammar
- Style and variant generation
- Convert images to video
