# SceneAPI

## Scene Loading

### loadFromString()

Load the contents of a scene file.
The string must be the binary contents of a scene file and is directly imported as blocks. Any existing scene is replaced by the new one.
This is useful for loading scenes that were saved with `saveToString` or scenes that were created in another editor instance.
```javascript
const sceneContent = await creativeEngine.scene.saveToString();
creativeEngine.scene.loadFromString(sceneContent);
```

```typescript
loadFromString(sceneContent: string, overrideEditorConfig?: boolean, waitForResources?: boolean): Promise<DesignBlockId>
```

**Parameters:**
- `sceneContent` - The scene file contents, a base64 string.
- `overrideEditorConfig` - Whether to override editor configuration with settings and data from the scene file. Defaults to false.
- `waitForResources` - Whether to wait for all resources to finish loading before resolving. Defaults to false.

**Returns:** A handle to the loaded scene.

### loadFromURL()

Load a scene from the URL to the scene file.
The scene file will be fetched asynchronously by the engine and loaded into the engine once it is available. Any existing scene is replaced by the new one.
```javascript
const sceneURL = 'https://example.com/my-scene.json';
creativeEngine.scene.loadFromURL(sceneURL);
```

```typescript
loadFromURL(url: string, overrideEditorConfig?: boolean, waitForResources?: boolean): Promise<DesignBlockId>
```

**Parameters:**
- `url` - The URL of the scene file.
- `overrideEditorConfig` - Whether to override editor configuration with settings and data from the scene file. Defaults to false.
- `waitForResources` - Whether to wait for all resources to finish loading before resolving. Defaults to false.

**Returns:** scene A promise that resolves once the scene was loaded or rejects with an error otherwise.

### loadFromArchiveURL()

Load a previously archived scene from the URL to the scene file.
The scene file will be fetched asynchronously by the engine. This requires continuous `render`
calls on this engines instance.

```typescript
loadFromArchiveURL(url: string, overrideEditorConfig?: boolean, waitForResources?: boolean): Promise<DesignBlockId>
```

**Parameters:**
- `url` - The URL of the scene archive file.
- `overrideEditorConfig` - Whether to override editor configuration with settings and data from the scene file. Defaults to false.
- `waitForResources` - Whether to wait for all resources to finish loading before resolving. Defaults to false.

**Returns:** scene A promise that resolves once the scene was loaded or rejects with an error otherwise.

## Scene Saving

### saveToString()

Serializes the current scene into a string. Selection is discarded.

```typescript
saveToString(allowedResourceSchemes?: string[], onDisallowedResourceScheme?: (url: string, dataHash: string) => Promise<string>): Promise<string>
```

**Parameters:**
- `allowedResourceSchemes` - The resource schemes to allow in the saved string. Defaults to ['blob', 'bundle', 'file', 'http', 'https', 'opfs'].
- `onDisallowedResourceScheme` - An optional callback that is called for each resource URL that has a scheme absent from
`resourceSchemesAllowed`. The `url` parameter is the resource URL and the `dataHash` parameter is the hash of the
resource's data. The callback should return a new URL for the resource, which will be used in the serialized
scene. The callback is expected to return the original URL if no persistence is needed.

**Returns:** A promise that resolves with a string on success or an error on failure.

### saveToArchive()

Saves the current scene and all of its referenced assets into an archive.
The archive contains all assets, that were accessible when this function was called.
Blocks in the archived scene reference assets relative from to the location of the scene
file. These references are resolved when loading such a scene via `loadSceneFromURL`.

```typescript
saveToArchive(): Promise<Blob>
```

**Returns:** A promise that resolves with a Blob on success or an error on failure.

## Scene Creation

### create()

```javascript
const mode = scene.getMode();
```

```typescript
getMode(): SceneMode
```

Changing the scene mode affects how the engine processes and renders the scene:
- Video mode enables timeline-based playback, animations, and audio processing.
- Design mode disables playback-related features and uses different color space settings.
```javascript
engine.scene.setMode('Video');
```

```typescript
setMode(mode: SceneMode): void
```

When transitioning from stack layouts (VerticalStack, HorizontalStack, DepthStack) to Free layout,
the global positions of pages are preserved to maintain their visual appearance in the scene.
```javascript
engine.scene.setLayout('VerticalStack');
```

```typescript
setLayout(layout: SceneLayout): void
```

**Parameters:**
- `layout` - The new layout for the scene.

## Template Operations

### applyTemplateFromString()

Applies the contents of the given template scene to the currently loaded scene.
This loads the template scene while keeping the design unit and page dimensions
of the current scene. The content of the pages is automatically adjusted to fit
the new dimensions.

```

```typescript
applyTemplateFromString(content: string): Promise<void>
```

**Parameters:**
- `content` - The template scene file contents, a base64 string.

**Returns:** A Promise that resolves once the template was applied or rejects if there was an error.

### applyTemplateFromURL()

Applies the contents of the given template scene to the currently loaded scene.
This loads the template scene while keeping the design unit and page dimensions
of the current scene. The content of the pages is automatically adjusted to fit
the new dimensions.

**Returns:** A list of block ids sorted by distance to viewport center.

## Camera & Zoom

### setZoomLevel()

Set the zoom level of the scene, e.g., for headless versions.
This only shows an effect if the zoom level is not handled/overwritten by the UI.
Setting a zoom level of 2.0f results in one dot in the design to be two pixels on the screen.
```javascript
// Zoom to 100%
engine.scene.setZoomLevel(1.0);
// Zoom to 50%
engine.scene.setZoomLevel(0.5 * engine.scene.getZoomLevel());
```

```typescript
setZoomLevel(zoomLevel?: number): void
```

**Parameters:**
- `zoomLevel` - The new zoom level.

### getZoomLevel()

Get the zoom level of the scene or for a camera in the scene in unit `dpx/dot`. A zoom level of 2.0 results in one pixel in the design to be two pixels
on the screen.
```javascript
const zoomLevel = engine.scene.getZoomLevel();
```

```typescript
getZoomLevel(): number
```

**Returns:** The zoom level of the block's camera.

### zoomToBlock() *(deprecated)*

Sets the zoom and focus to show a block.
This only shows an effect if the zoom level is not handled/overwritten by the UI.
Without padding, this results in a tight view on the block.
```javascript
// Bring entire scene in view with padding of 20px in all directions
engine.scene.zoomToBlock(scene, 20.0, 20.0, 20.0, 20.0);

- `paddingLeft` - Optional padding in screen pixels to the left of the block.
- `paddingTop` - Optional padding in screen pixels to the top of the block.
- `paddingRight` - Optional padding in screen pixels to the right of the block.
- `paddingBottom` - Optional padding in screen pixels to the bottom of the block.

**Returns:** A promise that resolves once the zoom was set or rejects with an error otherwise.

### enableZoomAutoFit()

Continually adjusts the zoom level to fit the width or height of a block's axis-aligned bounding box.
This only shows an effect if the zoom level is not handled/overwritten by the UI.
Without padding, this results in a tight view on the block.
Calling `setZoomLevel` or `zoomToBlock` disables the continuous adjustment.
```javascript
// Follow page with padding of 20px in both directions
engine.scene.enableZoomAutoFit(page, 'Both', 20.0, 20.0, 20.0, 20.0);
```

```typescript
enableZoomAutoFit(id: DesignBlockId, axis: 'Both', paddingLeft?: number, paddingTop?: number, paddingRight?: number, paddingBottom?: number): void
```

**Parameters:**
- `id` - The block for which the zoom is adjusted.
- `axis` - The block axis for which the zoom is adjusted.
- `paddingLeft` - Optional padding in screen pixels to the left of the block.
- `paddingTop` - Optional padding in screen pixels to the top of the block.
- `paddingRight` - Optional padding in screen pixels to the right of the block.
- `paddingBottom` - Optional padding in screen pixels to the bottom of the block.

### disableZoomAutoFit()

Disables any previously set zoom auto-fit.
```javascript
engine.scene.disableZoomAutoFit(scene);
```

```typescript
disableZoomAutoFit(blockOrScene: DesignBlockId): void
```

**Parameters:**
- `blockOrScene` - The scene or a block in the scene for which to disable zoom auto-fit.

### isZoomAutoFitEnabled()

Queries whether zoom auto-fit is enabled for the given block.
```javascript
engine.scene.isZoomAutoFitEnabled(scene);
```

```typescript
isZoomAutoFitEnabled(blockOrScene: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

**Parameters:**
- `blockOrScene` - The scene or a block in the scene for which to query the zoom auto-fit.

**Returns:** True if the given block has auto-fit set or the scene contains a block for which auto-fit is set, false
otherwise.

## Experimental Features

Experimental features that may change or be removed in future versions.

### unstable_enableCameraPositionClamping()

Continually ensures the camera position to be within the width and height of the blocks axis-aligned bounding box.
Disables any previously set camera position clamping in the scene and also takes priority over clamp camera commands.
```javascript
// Keep the scene with padding of 10px within the camera
engine.scene.unstable_enableCameraPositionClamping([scene], 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
```
Without padding, this results in a tight clamp on the block. With padding, the padded part of the
blocks is ensured to be visible.

```typescript
unstable_enableCameraPositionClamping(ids: DesignBlockId[], paddingLeft?: number, paddingTop?: number, paddingRight?: number, paddingBottom?: number, scaledPaddingLeft?: number, scaledPaddingTop?: number, scaledPaddingRight?: number, scaledPaddingBottom?: number): void
