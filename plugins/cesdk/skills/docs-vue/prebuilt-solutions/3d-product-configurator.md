## What is the 3D Product Configurator Solution?

The 3D Product Configurator is a demonstration of how CE.SDK can be extended to support interactive, real-time 3D visualizations. It allows your users to place their designs on lifelike product models and instantly preview the results.

Although 3D rendering isn’t a built-in part of CE.SDK, this solution shows how easy it is to integrate with external 3D engines using CE.SDK’s flexible API. The result is a seamless design-to-visualization workflow—all within a browser.

This solution currently supports business cards, apparel, and base caps. You can easily adapt it to support other product types such as stationery, accessories, or home goods.
