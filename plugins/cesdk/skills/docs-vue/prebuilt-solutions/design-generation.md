## What is the Design Generator Solution?

The Design Generator is a pre-built solution powered by CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) that enables developers to programmatically create design variations from a set of input parameters. Whether you're building a social media automation tool or a creative content engine, this solution lets you generate ready-to-use assets—such as static images and short video clips—based on user or system-defined data.

Built with CE.SDK’s headless API, this solution runs fully in the browser and can be embedded into any web application. It combines the flexibility of templated design logic with the scalability of automation.

## Key Features

- **Automated Design Generation**\
  Generate assets dynamically using a combination of input fields, preconfigured templates, and the CE.SDK variable and placeholder APIs.

- **Data Integration**\
  Seamlessly connect to external sources (e.g., podcast libraries or CMS data) to drive content generation.

- **Multi-format Output**\
  Export assets in different aspect ratios and sizes, including formats like Instagram Stories, Facebook Posts, and custom resolutions.

- **Real-time Editing**\
  Let users refine auto-generated content in a UI-based editor powered by CE.SDK—perfect for last-mile customization.

- **Custom Templates**\
  Use your own templates or adapt existing ones to define layout, font styles, colors, and asset constraints.
