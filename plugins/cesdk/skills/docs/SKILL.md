# CE.SDK Documentation

**Query**: $ARGUMENTS

Covers Web (React, Vue.js, Svelte, Angular, Electron, Vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, Nuxt.js, Next.js, SvelteKit); Flutter (Dart) on iOS and Android; React Native (TypeScript) on iOS and Android; Swift on iOS, macOS, and Mac Catalyst; Kotlin and Jetpack Compose on Android.

## Platform Detection

Detect the platform from the project files, then read the matching reference folder.

| Project files | Platform | Reference folder |
|---------------|----------|------------------|
| `pubspec.yaml` (its `android/` and `ios/` folders belong to the Flutter app) | Flutter (Dart; native editor on iOS and Android) | `references/flutter/` |
| `react-native` in `package.json` dependencies (its `android/` and `ios/` folders belong to the React Native app) | React Native (TypeScript; native editor on iOS and Android) | `references/react-native/` |
| `Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`, or `*.xcworkspace` | Swift (iOS, macOS, Mac Catalyst) | `references/swift/` |
| `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`, or `settings.gradle*` | Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose) | `references/android/` |
| `package.json` | Web — pick the framework from its dependencies (table below) | `references/web/<framework>/` |

Match the rows in the order listed. A Flutter or React Native project also
holds `android/` and `ios/` folders, and a React Native project lists
`react` in `package.json`; those files belong to the wrapper app, so its row
wins over the Swift, Android, and Web rows.

### Web framework from `package.json` dependencies

Check in this order: `react-native` → React Native (the row above, not Web), then `next` → Next.js, `nuxt` → Nuxt.js, `@sveltejs/kit` → SvelteKit,
`@angular/core` → Angular, `svelte` → Svelte, `vue` → Vue.js, `react` → React,
`electron` → Electron, `@cesdk/node` or a server project → Node.js, none → Vanilla JS.

| Framework | Reference folder |
|-----------|------------------|
| React | `references/web/react/` |
| Vue.js | `references/web/vue/` |
| Svelte | `references/web/svelte/` |
| Angular | `references/web/angular/` |
| Electron | `references/web/electron/` |
| Vanilla JavaScript | `references/web/js/` |
| Node.js | `references/web/node/` |
| Nuxt.js | `references/web/nuxtjs/` |
| Next.js | `references/web/nextjs/` |
| SvelteKit | `references/web/sveltekit/` |

A monorepo with several of these files or an empty folder is ambiguous: **ask the user which platform and framework to target**
instead of guessing. Never mix content from two platforms in one answer, except
that a Flutter or React Native answer adds the Swift and Kotlin code its native
mapping calls for.

## How to Use

1. Detect the platform and framework as above.
2. Read `README.md` in the matching reference folder. It holds the compressed
   documentation index, the API index, and the lookup workflow for that platform.
3. Follow that workflow: resolve the index entry to a file with Glob under the
   reference folder, or Grep the folder for the keyword.
4. Answer with the relevant section and code examples. Verify types and package
   names against the bundled files, never against memory.
