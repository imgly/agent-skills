### What is CE.SDK?

**CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK)** is a powerful design engine that brings fully customizable image, video, and design editing directly into your MacOS app. Whether you're enabling AI-powered design workflows, template-based creation, dynamic content generation, or full-featured creative editing, CE.SDK offers the flexibility, performance, and developer control you need — all with minimal integration overhead.

Trusted by leading organizations worldwide, CE.SDK powers the creative editors used in best-in-class applications, including those from Shopify, Semrush, HP, Shutterfly, Ticketmaster, and Swiss Post.

## File Format Support

CE.SDK supports a wide range of file types to ensure maximum flexibility for developers:

### Importing Media

| Category      | Supported Formats                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Images**    | `.png`, `.apng`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.bmp`  |
| **Video**     | `.mp4` (H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC), `.mov` (H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC)     |
| **Audio**     | `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.mp4` (AAC or MP3), `.mov` (AAC or MP3)   |
| **Animation** | `.json` (Lottie)                                                   |

Animated images (`.gif` and `.apng`) import as a static first frame in design
scenes and as a looping video fill in video scenes.

> **Note:** Need to import a format not listed here? CE.SDK allows you to create custom
> importers for any file type by using our Scene and Block APIs
> programmatically.

### Exporting Media

| Category    | Supported Formats                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Images**  | `.png` (with transparency), `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.tga`                                 |
| **Vector**  | `.svg` (scalable vector graphics with text as paths)                                 |
| **Print**   | `.pdf` (supports underlayer printing and spot colors)                                |
| **Video**   | `.mp4` (H.264 or H.265 on supported platforms with limited transparency support)     |
| **Scene**   | `.imgly` or `.scene` (description of the scene without any assets) |
| **Archive** | `.imgly` or `.zip` (fully self-contained archive that bundles the scene file with all assets) |

> **Note:** Our custom cross-platform C++ based rendering and layout engine ensures
> consistent output quality across devices.

### Importing Templates

| Format   | Description                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.idml`  | InDesign (via `@imgly/idml-importer`)                           |
| `.psd`   | Photoshop (via `@imgly/psd-importer`)                           |
| `.pdf`   | PDF (via `@imgly/pdf-importer`)                                 |
| `.pptx`  | PowerPoint (via `@imgly/pptx-importer`)                         |
| `.imgly` | CE.SDK Native (scene or archive, detected automatically)        |
| `.scene` | CE.SDK Native (scene extension)       |
| `.zip`   | CE.SDK Native (archive extension)     |

Non-native design files are converted into editable CE.SDK scenes by dedicated
importer packages rather than uploaded as media assets.

> **Note:** The `.idml`, `.psd`, `.pdf` and `.pptx` importers ship as separate packages
> that you install in addition to CE.SDK. These importer packages run only in
> the browser and in Node.js. They are not available on any other platform,
> including Android, iOS, Flutter and React Native.

> **Note:** Need to import a format not listed here? CE.SDK allows you to create custom
> importers for any file type by using our Scene and Block APIs to generate
> scenes programmatically.

For detailed information, see the [full file format support list](./file-format-support.md).
