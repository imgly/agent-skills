CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) supports a wide range of modern file types for importing assets and exporting final content. Whether you're working with images, videos, audio, documents, or fonts, CE.SDK provides a client-side editing environment with excellent media compatibility and performance—optimized for modern client-side hardware.

This guide outlines supported formats, codecs, and known limitations across media types.

## Importing Media

| Category      | Supported Formats                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Images**    | `.png`, `.apng`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.bmp`                       |
| **Video**     | `.mp4` (H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC), `.mov` (H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC), `.webm` (VP8, VP9, AV1 — not supported by the native `@cesdk/node-native` package) |
| **Audio**     | `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.mp4` (AAC or MP3), `.mov` (AAC or MP3)                        |
| **Animation** | `.json` (Lottie)                                                                        |

Animated images (`.gif` and `.apng`) import as a static first frame in design
scenes and as a looping video fill in video scenes.

> **Note:** Need to import a format not listed here? CE.SDK allows you to create custom
> importers for any file type by using our Scene and Block APIs
> programmatically.

### SVG Limitations

CE.SDK uses Skia for SVG parsing and rendering. While most SVG files render correctly, there are some important limitations to be aware of:

### Text Elements

- SVG text elements are not supported - any text in SVG files will not be rendered.
- Convert text to paths in your vector editor before exporting if text is needed.

### Styling Limitations

- CSS styles included in SVGs are not supported - use presentation attributes instead.
- RGBA color syntax is not supported - use `fill-opacity` and `stroke-opacity` attributes.
- When exporting SVGs from design tools, choose the "presentation attributes" option.

### Unsupported SVG Elements

The following SVG elements are not supported:

- Animation elements (`<animate>`)
- Foreign object (`<foreignObject>`)
- Text-related elements (`<altGlyph>`, `<font>`, `<glyph>`)
- Script elements (`<script>`)
- Some filter elements (`<feComponentTransfer>`, `<feConvolveMatrix>`, `<feTile>`, `<feDropShadow>`)
- Inlined SVGs via `<image>` or `<feImage>` elements

## Exporting Media

| Category    | Supported Formats                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Images**  | `.png` (with transparency), `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.tga`                                 |
| **Vector**  | `.svg` (scalable vector graphics with text as paths)                                 |
| **Print**   | `.pdf` (supports underlayer printing and spot colors)                                |
| **Video**   | `.mp4` (H.264 or H.265 on supported platforms with limited transparency support)     |
| **Scene**   | `.imgly` or `.scene` (description of the scene without any assets) |
| **Archive** | `.imgly` or `.zip` (fully self-contained archive that bundles the scene file with all assets) |

> **Note:** Our custom cross-platform C++ based rendering and layout engine ensures
> consistent output quality across devices.

You can also export scenes to HTML — static designs and animated video
timelines — with the separate `@imgly/html-exporter` package, which runs in the
browser and in Node.js.

## Importing Templates

| Format   | Description                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.idml`  | InDesign (via `@imgly/idml-importer`)                           |
| `.psd`   | Photoshop (via `@imgly/psd-importer`)                           |
| `.pdf`   | PDF (via `@imgly/pdf-importer`)                                 |
| `.pptx`  | PowerPoint (via `@imgly/pptx-importer`)                         |
| `.imgly` | CE.SDK Native (scene or archive, detected automatically)        |
| `.scene` | CE.SDK Native (scene extension)       |
| `.zip`   | CE.SDK Native (archive extension)     |

Non-native design files are converted into editable CE.SDK scenes by dedicated
importer packages rather than uploaded as media assets.

> **Note:** The `.idml`, `.psd`, `.pdf` and `.pptx` importers ship as separate packages
> that you install in addition to CE.SDK. These importer packages run only in
> the browser and in Node.js. They are not available on any other platform,
> including Android, iOS, Flutter and React Native.

> **Note:** Need to import a format not listed here? CE.SDK allows you to create custom
> importers for any file type by using our Scene and Block APIs to generate
> scenes programmatically.

See [Import and Export](./concepts/import-export.md) for
how these import and export workflows fit together.

## Font Formats

| Format   | Description                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| `.ttf`   | TrueType Font                     |
| `.otf`   | OpenType Font                     |
| `.woff`  | Web Open Font Format              |
| `.woff2` | Compressed Web Open Font Format 2 |

> **Note:** Fonts should be appropriately licensed before being embedded in your
> application.

## Video & Audio Codecs

CE.SDK supports the most widely adopted video and audio codecs to ensure compatibility across platforms:

### **Video Codecs**

- **H.264 / AVC** (in `.mp4`)
- **H.265 / HEVC** (in `.mp4`, may require platform-specific support)

### **Audio Codecs**

- **MP3** (in `.mp3` or within `.mp4`)
- **AAC** (in `.m4a` or within `.mp4` or `.mov`)

These codecs apply to importing media. For export, CE.SDK produces MP4 with H.264 (H.265 only on supported browser and mobile platforms); the native Node.js package (`@cesdk/node-native`) exports H.264 video with AAC audio.

## Size Limits

### Image Resolution Limits

| Constraint            | Recommendation / Limit                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input Resolution**  | Maximum input resolution is **4096×4096 pixels**. Images from external sources (e.g., Unsplash) are resized to this size before rendering on the canvas. You can modify this value using the `maxImageSize` setting.  |
| **Output Resolution** | There is no enforced output resolution limit. Theoretically, the editor supports output sizes up to **16,384×16,384 pixels**. However, practical limits depend on the device's GPU capabilities and available memory. |

All image processing in CE.SDK happens on the device running the engine, so these values depend on the **maximum texture size** supported by its hardware. The default limit of 4096×4096 is a safe baseline that works universally. Higher resolutions (e.g., 8192×8192) may work on certain devices but could fail on others during export if the GPU texture size is exceeded.

> **Note:** To ensure consistent results across devices, it’s best to test higher output
> sizes on your target hardware and set conservative defaults in production.

### Video Resolution & Duration Limits

| Constraint     | Recommendation / Limit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Resolution** | Up to **4K UHD** is supported for **playback** and **export**, depending on the user's hardware and available GPU resources. For **import**, CE.SDK does not impose artificial limits, but maximum video size is bounded by available memory: WASM-based builds (browser and `@cesdk/node`) are limited by the **32-bit address space of WebAssembly (wasm32)** and, in the browser, the **tab’s memory cap (~2 GB)**, while native builds such as `@cesdk/node-native` can use the full process memory. |
| **Frame Rate** | 30 FPS at 1080p is broadly supported; 60 FPS and high-res exports benefit from hardware acceleration                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Duration**   | Stories and reels of up to **2 minutes** are fully supported. Longer videos are also supported, but we generally found a maximum duration of **10 minutes** to be a good balance for a smooth editing experience and a pleasant export duration of around one minute on modern hardware.                                       |

> **Note:** Performance scales with the host hardware. For best results with high-resolution
> or high-frame-rate video, modern CPUs/GPUs with hardware acceleration are
> recommended.
