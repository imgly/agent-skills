This guide gives you a high-level look at what CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) can do—and how deeply it can integrate into your workflows. Whether you’re building a design editor into your product, enabling automation, or scaling personalized content creation, CE.SDK provides a flexible and future-ready foundation.

It’s designed for developers, product teams, and technical decision-makers evaluating how CE.SDK fits their use case.

- 100% in-process processing — no external services required
- Custom-built rendering engine for consistent cross-platform performance
- Flexible enough for both low-code and fully custom implementations

## Design Creation and Editing

CE.SDK provides comprehensive tools for creating and editing images, videos, and multi-page layouts directly in your application with full feature parity to desktop applications.

### Core Capabilities

- Create, edit, compose, and customize visual content
- Dual control: Use the built-in editor UI or programmatic API
- Rich editing tools: filters, text styling, stickers, layers, and layout controls

### Supported Workflows

- Social media content creation and user-generated content flows
- Marketing tools for creative teams
- Branded asset creation (slides, product visuals, templates)
- Composition tools for multi-page layouts, collages, and background blending

## Templates and Reusable Layouts

Define reusable templates to simplify design creation. These templates support:

- Role-based editing (lock/unlock elements based on user type)
- Smart placeholders (predefined image/text drop zones)
- Preset styles for consistent branding
- Programmatic or user-driven updates

Templates make it easy to scale consistent design output while keeping editing intuitive.

## Automation and Dynamic Content

You can generate visuals automatically by combining templates with structured data.

Common use cases include personalized ads, localizations, product catalogs, or A/B testing. The SDK works in headless mode and supports batch workflows, making it easy to automate at scale.

## Multi-modal

CE.SDK supports a wide range of content types and formats:

- Input types: images, video, audio, structured data, templates
- Output formats: PNG, JPEG, WebP, PDF, raw data, and MP4 video (with the native `@cesdk/node-native` package)

All operations—including export—run inside your Node.js process, ensuring fast performance and data privacy.

## Extensibility

Need to add a custom feature or integrate with your backend? CE.SDK supports extensibility at multiple levels:

- Backend data integrations (e.g., asset management systems)
- Custom logic or validation rules
- Advanced export workflows

The SDK’s plugin architecture ensures you can scale your functionality without rebuilding the core editor.

## Content Libraries

CE.SDK ships with a robust system for managing reusable content:

- Built-in libraries of stickers, icons, overlays, and fonts
- Integration with third-party providers like Getty Images, Unsplash
- Programmatic filtering and categorization
- Organize by brand, user, or use case

This makes it easy to deliver a seamless editing experience—no matter how many assets you manage.
