The CE.SDK Agent Skills plugin gives AI coding assistants bundled documentation,
guided code generation, and project scaffolding for building applications with
CreativeEditor SDK across 10 Web frameworks, Swift on Apple platforms, Kotlin
with Jetpack Compose on Android, and the Flutter and React Native wrappers.

## What Are Agent Skills?

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) are portable knowledge packs that plug into AI coding assistants. By installing the CE.SDK skills, you get:

- **Offline documentation**: All guides, API references, and best practices bundled locally — no external API calls
- **Guided code generation**: Build and explain skills that walk through CE.SDK implementation step by step
- **Autonomous scaffolding**: The build skill creates and verifies complete CE.SDK projects from scratch

## Available Skills

One `cesdk` plugin contains three skills. Each skill detects the platform and
framework from your project and reads the matching bundled references:

| Skill     | Description                                                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs`    | Look up CE.SDK guides and API reference for your platform and framework            |
| `explain` | Explain how CE.SDK features work — concepts, architecture, workflows               |
| `build`   | Implement features and scaffold complete CE.SDK projects from bundled starter kits |

Claude Code additionally receives a thin optional `builder` agent adapter that
delegates to the same `build` skill. Codex uses the `build` skill directly.

The bundled references cover:

| Platform     | Frameworks and modules                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web          | React, Vue.js, Svelte, SvelteKit, Angular, Next.js, Nuxt.js, Electron, Vanilla JS, Node.js                       |
| Swift        | `IMGLYEngine`, `IMGLYCore`, `IMGLYCoreUI`, `IMGLYCamera`, `IMGLYEditor` on iOS, macOS, Mac Catalyst              |
| Android      | Engine, editor, and camera Kotlin APIs with Jetpack Compose                                                      |
| Flutter      | `imgly_editor` and `imgly_camera` (Dart); the native editor on iOS and Android                                   |
| React Native | `@imgly/editor-react-native` and `@imgly/camera-react-native` (TypeScript); the native editor on iOS and Android |

`IMGLYEngine` is available on iOS, macOS, and Mac Catalyst. The prebuilt editor,
camera, UI modules, and bundled starter kits are iOS-only. When available, the
skills prefer live Xcode symbols for the installed SDK and use bundled API
digests as a portable fallback. The Android API reference is distilled from
first-party Dokka Markdown into compact per-type digests.

The Flutter and React Native references hold the wrapper's own Dart or
TypeScript API as per-type digests, the wrapper guides, runnable examples from
the showcases apps, and a mapping document that says which customizations are
written in Swift and Kotlin. For those, the skills read the bundled Swift and
Android references, so a wrapper project never needs a second install. To
change part of a prebuilt editor, such as its dock, the skills start from the
wrapper's own Swift and Kotlin sources, which the plugin bundles with their
IMG.LY license.

When a project mixes platforms, or the platform is not clear from the files,
the skill asks which platform you mean before it reads any reference.

### Manual Copy

For any skills-compatible agent, copy skill folders directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/imgly/agent-skills):

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/imgly/agent-skills.git

# Copy a skill into your agent's skills directory
cp -r agent-skills/plugins/cesdk/skills/docs <skills-directory>/docs
cp -r agent-skills/plugins/cesdk/skills/explain <skills-directory>/explain
cp -r agent-skills/plugins/cesdk/skills/build <skills-directory>/build
```

## Keeping Skills Current

Every generated skill records its CE.SDK version, generation date, and plugin
identifier. When a bundle is over six weeks old, or when you ask about updates,
the assistant can compare it with the matching stable, prerelease, or nightly
IMG.LY channel. This check is read-only.

Before changing anything, the assistant must identify whether the active skill
came from Claude Code, Codex, the Skills CLI, a Git checkout, or a manual copy.
It reports unknown or ambiguous installations instead of guessing and requests
explicit approval for the exact update command and target.

## Prerelease and Nightly Versions

By default every install method above tracks the **latest stable** CE.SDK release. If you build against a prerelease or nightly engine build (for example `@cesdk/node-native` on the `next` or `dev` npm dist-tag), you can install the matching skills from a dedicated release channel. The channels mirror the npm dist-tag names:

| Channel    | Branch            | Matches engine dist-tag | Contents                                              |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Stable     | `main` / `latest` | `latest`                | Latest stable release (default)                       |
| Prerelease | `next`            | `next`                  | Latest release candidate (e.g. `1.77.0-rc.4`)         |
| Nightly    | `dev`             | `dev`                   | Latest nightly build (e.g. `1.78.0-nightly.20260630`) |

Every published version is also available under an exact `v<version>` Git tag.
Use the channel-specific instructions below to track a moving channel or pin one
published build.

> **Note:** The `v<version>` tag for a given nightly only exists if that nightly actually published skills — when a night's generated content is identical to the previous publish, no new tag is created for that date.

### Claude Code Plugin

Pin the marketplace to a channel branch or a version tag with the `@<ref>` suffix:

```bash
# Prerelease (release candidate) channel — latest rc
claude plugin marketplace add imgly/agent-skills@next
claude plugin install cesdk@imgly

# Nightly channel — latest nightly
claude plugin marketplace add imgly/agent-skills@dev
claude plugin install cesdk@imgly

# A specific published version
claude plugin marketplace add imgly/agent-skills@v1.78.0-nightly.20260630
claude plugin install cesdk@imgly
```

### Codex Plugin

Add the matching marketplace ref:

```bash
# Prerelease channel
codex plugin marketplace add imgly/agent-skills@next
codex plugin add cesdk@imgly

# Nightly channel
codex plugin marketplace add imgly/agent-skills@dev
codex plugin add cesdk@imgly

# A specific published version
codex plugin marketplace add imgly/agent-skills@v1.78.0-nightly.20260630
codex plugin add cesdk@imgly
```

### Vercel Skills CLI

Put the channel branch or version tag in the `/tree/<ref>` segment of the repository URL:

```bash
# Nightly channel — latest nightly
npx skills add https://github.com/imgly/agent-skills/tree/dev -a claude-code

# A specific published version
npx skills add https://github.com/imgly/agent-skills/tree/v1.78.0-nightly.20260630 -a claude-code

# A single skill from a pinned version
npx skills add https://github.com/imgly/agent-skills/tree/v1.78.0-nightly.20260630 --skill docs -a claude-code
```

### Manual Copy

Clone a specific channel branch or an exact version tag:

```bash
# Nightly channel — latest nightly
git clone -b dev https://github.com/imgly/agent-skills.git

# A specific published version
git clone -b v1.78.0-nightly.20260630 https://github.com/imgly/agent-skills.git
```

## Usage

Ask naturally and let your assistant select the right skill. For explicit
selection, type `/` in Claude Code or `$` in Codex, then select the matching
skill from the installed CE.SDK plugin. Name the platform or framework in your
request when the project does not make it obvious.

### Look up documentation

```text
Use the docs skill to look up CE.SDK configuration for React.
Use the docs skill for getting started with Vue.
Use the docs skill to look up IMGLYEngine asset sources.
Use the docs skill to look up BlockApi.create on Android.
```

### Build a feature

```text
Use the build skill to add text overlays to images.
Use the build skill to create a photo editor with filters in Next.js.
Use the build skill to create an iOS photo editor.
Use the build skill to create a Compose photo editor.
```

### Explain a concept

```text
Use the explain skill to describe how the block hierarchy works.
Use the explain skill to describe the export pipeline and output formats.
Use the explain skill to describe custom editor UI on macOS.
Use the explain skill to describe the EditorConfiguration.remember lifecycle.
```

## How It Works

The `docs` skill bundles the complete CE.SDK guides and API references for every
supported Web framework, the Swift modules, and the Android APIs as plain
Markdown under `references/`. Skills read directly from these local files — no
external services or MCP servers are required.

The `build` skill includes starter kit templates for common use cases like
design editors, video editors, and photo editors. It selects the matching Web,
Swift, or Android project structure and generates code accordingly.
