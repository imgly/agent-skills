In CE.SDK, assets are the building blocks of your creative workflow—whether they’re images, videos, audio, fonts, or templates. They power everything from basic image edits to dynamic, template-driven design generation.

This guide gives you a high-level understanding of how to bring assets into CE.SDK, where they can come from, and how to decide on the right strategy for your application. Whether you're working with local uploads, remote storage, or third-party sources, this guide will help you navigate your options and build an efficient import pipeline.

## What is an Asset?

In CE.SDK, an *asset* refers to any external media that can be inserted into a design scene. Assets are referenced via URIs, and are not stored or hosted by CE.SDK itself.

Supported asset types include:

- **Images** – JPEG, PNG, WebP, SVG, etc.
- **Video** – MP4, MOV
- **Audio / Music** – MP3, AAC
- **Fonts** – Custom or system fonts
- **Stickers** – SVG or PNG elements
- **Templates** – Design presets or prebuilt scenes
- **Custom Media** – Any content with a valid URI and supported format

See a [full list of supported file formats](./file-format-support.md).

Assets are used throughout the editor to fill shapes, provide visual or audio decoration, or serve as core scene content.

## Asset Sources in CE.SDK

CE.SDK supports a range of asset sources, allowing developers to import media from:

- **Local Sources**\
  Assets directly uploaded by the user (e.g., from their device).
- **Remote Sources**\
  Media served via external servers or your own backend (e.g., S3, CDN).
- **Third-Party Sources**\
  Create custom integrations with Unsplash, Getty, etc.
- **Dynamic Sources**\
  Assets created or fetched on demand (e.g., generative AI images).

> **Note:** **Note:** When a user opens the editor, CE.SDK downloads any referenced assets
> to the local environment for use within the editing session.

### When to Use Each Asset Source

| Use Case                             | Recommended Source Type |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| End-users upload personal media      | Local Source            |
| Use your company’s asset library     | Remote Source           |
| Enable searchable stock assets       | Third-Party Source      |
| Fetch real-time AI-generated content | Dynamic Source          |

With **Local Asset Sources**, CE.SDK powers search functionality directly in the client application. For **Remote Asset Sources**, searching and indexing are typically offloaded to the server to ensure scalability and performance.

> **Note:** **Performance Tip:** If you’re managing **thousands of assets**, it's best to
> offload search and filtering to a **remote backend** to avoid performance
> bottlenecks on the client.

## Asset Storage and Management in CE.SDK

### No Built-In Storage Provided

CE.SDK does **not** host or store assets. You must handle storage using your infrastructure:

- Amazon S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Firebase
- Your own custom backend

### How It Works

- Assets are referenced via **URIs**—not embedded or stored internally.
- You implement a **custom asset source**, which returns references to assets via CE.SDK's API.
- Assets are then made available in the **Asset Library** or loaded programmatically.

### Custom Asset Libraries

CE.SDK is fully modular. You define how assets are fetched, filtered, categorized, and presented. This works for all asset types: images, videos, audio, and even uploads.

### Uploading Assets

CE.SDK supports upload workflows using your own infrastructure:

- Use `onUpload` callbacks to trigger uploads.
- Notify CE.SDK about changed asset sources with `assetSourceContentsChanged`.

### Best Practices

Work with your backend team to:

- Define where assets are stored and how they’re indexed.
- Ensure secure, performant delivery of media files.
- Implement custom asset source logic based on CE.SDK’s source API.

## Using and Customizing the Asset Library

The built-in Asset Library gives users a way to browse and insert assets visually.

You can:

- Add or remove asset categories (images, stickers, audio, etc.).
- Customize the layout, filters, and tab order.
- Show assets from your own remote sources.
- Dynamically refresh asset lists when new files are uploaded.

## Default Assets

CE.SDK includes a set of default assets (images, templates, stickers, etc.) for testing or bootstrapping a demo.

You can:

- Use them in development for fast prototyping.
- Customize or remove them entirely for production apps.

Use platform-specific asset source setup to populate the default library.

## Third-Party Asset Integrations

CE.SDK supports integrations with popular content platforms:

- **Unsplash** – High-quality free stock images
- **Pexels** – Free photos and videos
- **Getty Images** – Licensed, premium content
- **Soundstripe** – Music and audio tracks for video scenes

> **Note:** You can also integrate any other source using a custom asset source and the
> standard asset source API.

## File Type Support

CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) supports importing high-resolution images, video, and audio content.

| Category      | Supported Formats                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Images**    | `.png`, `.apng`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.bmp`                       |
| **Video**     | `.mp4` (H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC), `.mov` (H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC), `.webm` (VP8, VP9, AV1 — not supported by the native `@cesdk/node-native` package) |
| **Audio**     | `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.mp4` (AAC or MP3), `.mov` (AAC or MP3)                        |
| **Animation** | `.json` (Lottie)                                                                        |

Animated images (`.gif` and `.apng`) import as a static first frame in design
scenes and as a looping video fill in video scenes.

> **Note:** Need to import a format not listed here? CE.SDK allows you to create custom
> importers for any file type by using our Scene and Block APIs
> programmatically.

## Media Constraints

### Image Resolution Limits

| Constraint            | Recommendation / Limit                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input Resolution**  | Maximum input resolution is **4096×4096 pixels**. Images from external sources (e.g., Unsplash) are resized to this size before rendering on the canvas. You can modify this value using the `maxImageSize` setting.  |
| **Output Resolution** | There is no enforced output resolution limit. Theoretically, the editor supports output sizes up to **16,384×16,384 pixels**. However, practical limits depend on the device's GPU capabilities and available memory. |

All image processing in CE.SDK happens on the device running the engine, so these values depend on the **maximum texture size** supported by its hardware. The default limit of 4096×4096 is a safe baseline that works universally. Higher resolutions (e.g., 8192×8192) may work on certain devices but could fail on others during export if the GPU texture size is exceeded.

> **Note:** To ensure consistent results across devices, it’s best to test higher output
> sizes on your target hardware and set conservative defaults in production.

### Video Resolution & Duration Limits

| Constraint     | Recommendation / Limit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Resolution** | Up to **4K UHD** is supported for **playback** and **export**, depending on the user's hardware and available GPU resources. For **import**, CE.SDK does not impose artificial limits, but maximum video size is bounded by available memory: WASM-based builds (browser and `@cesdk/node`) are limited by the **32-bit address space of WebAssembly (wasm32)** and, in the browser, the **tab’s memory cap (~2 GB)**, while native builds such as `@cesdk/node-native` can use the full process memory. |
| **Frame Rate** | 30 FPS at 1080p is broadly supported; 60 FPS and high-res exports benefit from hardware acceleration                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Duration**   | Stories and reels of up to **2 minutes** are fully supported. Longer videos are also supported, but we generally found a maximum duration of **10 minutes** to be a good balance for a smooth editing experience and a pleasant export duration of around one minute on modern hardware.                                       |

> **Note:** Performance scales with the host hardware. For best results with high-resolution
> or high-frame-rate video, modern CPUs/GPUs with hardware acceleration are
> recommended.
